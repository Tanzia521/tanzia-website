# Tanzia Hoque — Portfolio Site

Multi‑page, responsive portfolio built with semantic HTML5, CSS Grid/Flexbox, and subtle animations.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home
- `experience.html` — Work history
- `education.html` — Degrees & training (with placeholder logos)
- `about.html` — Summary & strengths
- `contact.html` — Contact details and form

## Customize
- Replace placeholders in **contact.html** for email, phone `+880‑1XXXXXXXXX`, and LinkedIn URL.
- Swap any logo in **assets/logos/** with official ones (keep the same filenames to update automatically).
- Update résumé at **assets/Tanzia_Hoque_Resume.pdf**.

## Hosting
Open `index.html` locally or host the folder on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
